# Introduction

**seeq-correlation** is a Python module to calculate and monitor cross-correlations among time-series signals. It also
calculates the time shifts (lead or lag) that maximize the cross-correlations of each signal pair. The module includes a
user interface (UI) designed to interact with the Seeq server. Specifically, the UI can be installed as an Add-on Tool
in Seeq Workbench.
